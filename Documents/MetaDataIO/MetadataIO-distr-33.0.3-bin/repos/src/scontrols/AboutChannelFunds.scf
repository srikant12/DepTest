						companies selling, marketing, and servicing their products and services through channel
						partners. The volume of marketing fund requests and claims tend to be very high. 
						The Channel Funds application offers best practice fund requests and claims management for
						channel managers and their partners. Typical channel funds programs are called coop 
						and MDF (market development funds). </FONT>
