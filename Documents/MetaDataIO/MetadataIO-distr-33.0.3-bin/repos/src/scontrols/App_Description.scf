<p>
From the creation of a new position through the interviews aimed at filling it, Recruiting for AppExchange offers a basic format for tracking your company’s evaluation of potential employees. It gives you a single location from which to manage the scheduling of candidate interviews and the posting of jobs on employment websites, plus you’ll be able to easily see what kind of progress you’re making toward filling a particular position. </p>
<p>
Recruiting gives hiring managers and recruiters at small to medium-sized companies one place they can go to monitor the candidate pipeline and see listings of positions and candidates. By deploying it, your company can extend its salesforce.com solution to gather measurable data to better target its recruiting efforts. </p>
<p>
Hint: There is another application in the AppExchange called Recruiting Manager that monitors a more formal hiring process. Feel free to compare the two apps.</p>

<h2 class="exchangeTitle">The AppExchange</h2>
<p>
The AppExchange is the world’s first on-demand application-sharing service. The dozens of pre-built applications and components it offers have been created by salesforce.com customers, developers, and partners. With these apps, users can do everything from managing expenses to tracking purchasing to monitoring recruiting. Companies can browse, test drive, and install these apps into their salesforce.com accounts with a single click.</p></font>
<p>Using the AppExchange, organizations can easily add new apps to their current salesforce.com deployments, run them alongside their existing on-demand applications, and easily customize them to meet their unique needs. The breadth of applications on the AppExchange — including CRM and many other types of business apps — is limited only by the imagination of its publishers and the on-demand community itself. </p></font>
